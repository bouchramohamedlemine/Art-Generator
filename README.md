## Art Generator
A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Net (DCGAN) model that
generates art paintings of five types, abstract, landscape, marina, flower and cityscape. To have more
control over what type of art the model generates, the conditional GAN technique was incorporated to
condition the model on the class of images to generate. The generated images were evaluated based on
their creativity, inheritance and diversity. Evaluation metrics showed that the model generates highly
creative and diverse images while inheriting most key attributes of most classes.
